/*
  React.JS is based on Virtual DOM.
  
  What is Virtual DOM?
    - Thatâ€™s where the concept of virtual DOM comes in and performs significantly better than the real DOM. The virtual DOM is only a virtual representation of the DOM.
      Everytime the state of our application changes, the virtual DOM gets updated instead of the real DOM.
